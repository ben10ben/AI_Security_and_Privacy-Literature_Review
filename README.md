# AI Security and Privacy: A State-of-the-Art Review

## Overview
This repository hosts the research work titled "AI Security and Privacy â€“ A State-of-the-Art Review," conducted by Benedikt Rein, Leila Zafarmand, and Theodor Rellin from Humboldt University Berlin, School of Business and Economics, Germany. The research presents a systematic mapping study exploring recent developments in AI security, privacy and alignment, including established frameworks and evaluation of scientific papers.

## Research Summary
The study evaluates a collection of 75 scientific papers selected through a systematic approach. It focuses on frameworks helping practitioners, managers, auditors, and policymakers make informed decisions regarding AI security and privacy. The research uses the EU AI Act as a normative starting point and derives lifecycle- and value-based mapping categories from the frameworks. Key topics include federated learning, privacy-preserving training, and adversarial attacks, with an in-depth analysis of AI system architecture, data management, model training, and more. Notably, the research highlights the emerging importance of bias management and AI alignment in the field.

## Key Findings
AI security and privacy is a rapidly evolving research area, with governments worldwide working on measures to ensure safe AI environments.
There's no one-size-fits-all solution for AI policy, and frameworks do not claim to be complete blueprints for managing AI security and privacy.
Recent topics include federated learning, privacy-preserving training, adversarial attacks, with less prominence on bias management and AI alignment.
There is a need for more exploratory research focusing on bias, alignment, safety, and explainability in AI systems.
